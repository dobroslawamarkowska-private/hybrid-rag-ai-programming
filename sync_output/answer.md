**Query:** How to install Docker Hub on Linux?

---

Such information is not in the documentation.

The closest match: The provided context includes instructions on how to install Docker Engine on Linux, but it does not cover the installation of Docker Hub. Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository service where you can store and share Docker images, and it does not require installation on a local machine. You can access Docker Hub through a web browser or use Docker CLI commands to interact with it.
