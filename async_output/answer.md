**Query:** How to install Docker Hub on Linux?

---

Such information is not in the documentation.

The closest match: Docker Hub is not something you install on Linux as it is a cloud-based service for storing and managing Docker images. You can interact with Docker Hub using the Docker CLI or API, and it integrates with Docker Desktop, which can be installed on Linux. Docker Desktop provides a GUI for managing containers and images, and it integrates with Docker Hub for accessing a vast ecosystem of images and templates.
